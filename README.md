## Thoughts

The class was very practical and useful to learn the way I present myself in front of the others. 
I got feedbacks from the professor (don't use fillers, make welcome page and contents table, put summary page, ...), and it was definitely helpful that I could improve myself. 

Because there were only few students, we could get closer to each other. All the presentations other students have made were impressive, and seeing them improving was also really meaningful. I learned a lot of things from them. 

We went to the art museum as field trip, went to the cafe, and we had chicken party after the final. All the small talk we had was very fun.

I really enjoyed this class.
